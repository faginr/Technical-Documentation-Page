				<p>So you want to make music. These days with the advent of modern digital technology, a lot can be accomplished with a simple laptop, a few pieces of hardware, and some basic software. Just getting started? No need to drop thousands of dollars on expensive and often complex equipment. This simple guide will give you all the tools you need to begin your foray into the rewarding field of modern musical production.</p>

				<p><strong>Before beginning</strong>, their are some baseline considerations that need to be met in order to have a usable working environment. Trying to force an underpowered workstation beyond its limits will end in hours wasted in frustration with little to nothing to show for it. In order to have a usable setup, the following basic items need to be present:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><em><strong>Computer:</strong></em> This is the central piece that drives the rest. Specifics will be covered later on.</li>
					<li><em><strong>Audio Playback:</strong></em> There's not much point in making music if you can't hear it. Speakers are recommended but headphones can work ok if you are just starting out.<li>
					<p>These two are necessary. If you want to expand your abilities, consider the following:<p>
					<li><em><strong>(Optional) Hard synth:</strong></em> Keyboards are the top compostion tools of the musical world for a reason. The highly visual nature of the keyboard is very useful in crafting music, whatever the type. Start with a solid budget option, and upgrade as you hit its limits.</li>
					<li><em><strong>(Optional) Audio Interface:</strong></em> Not only will this improve audio output controls, it will also also for real instruments and microphones to be recorded. Depending on the style of music this could be intergral to the sound.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Now that you have the tools, let's learn how to set them up for success. The two main componenets to making music on your computer are Software and Hardware. Let's take a quick look at each.</p>
				<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
				<p>On the software side of things, there are several components to install and configure into working order.</p>
				<p><strong>Driver</strong></p>
				<p>The driver will handle all of the inputs and outputs from the main software as requests to and from the computer. The simplest, easiest and cheapest (free) solution is a community built one that many people utilize called ASIO4ALL. Simply download and install and the driver will be taken care of (note: an audio interface may have its own driver to install and use).</p>
				<p><strong>Audio Software</strong></p>
				<p>There are many options for audio software out on the market today. A relatively inexpensive, robust, and free to try option is Reaper by cuckos. Again download and install.</p>
				<p><strong>Plugins</strong></p>
				<p>This section will make more sense once you get started, but essentially the effects and virtual instruments at your disposal come down to the plugins you have installed. A good place to start is to look up and try free plugins first, and purchase professional options once you have more experinece.</p>
				<p>Now lets look at Hardware.</p>
				<p><strong>Hardware</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Mid-tier computer:</strong> at a minimum, a computer will need:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><em>Multi-core processor.</em> Dual core is okay, quad core (or more) is better. Anything older will be too slow.</li>
						<li><em>1GB Ram.</em> Most new computers should have 2 or 4 GB (or more) and more is always better.</li>
						<li><em>160GB Storage.</em> Technically you can use less, but if you start making lots of projects you will soon run out of space. SSDs will also speed up loading times.</li>
					</ul>
				<p><strong>Audio Playback</strong></p> 
				<p>Many things will work here. Ideally you would have multiple devices to test your work on a variety of playback devices. A good set of speakers is the best for mixing and mastering, but good headphones or even cheap earbuds can work if you have nothing else.</p>
				<p><strong>HardSynth (Optional)</strong></p>
				<p>Its not totally necessary, but having a piano keyboard to help you compose will help greatly in the composition process, from melody to rhythm. Being able to record through the device is also a very useful tool. May require additional cords.</p>	
				<p><strong>Audio Interface (Optional)</strong></p>
				<p>Once you get further along, you may want to invest in an Audio Interface that plugs into your computer. Having dedicated drivers, powered inputs including phantom power, monitoring, and a host of othre benefits will enhance everything you do.</p>

				<p><strong>Settings/Configurations</strong></p>
				<p>You will need to make sure everything is in working order before you begin, or you may spend an hour wondering why you can't hear anything, only to find your speakers were unplugged the whole time./p>
				<p>A quick checklist to run through:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hardware is plugged in, turned on, and functioning properly.</li>
					<li>Driver is working properly.</li>
					<li>Software is installed.</li>
					<li>Inputs, outputs, and midi are all assigned in settings. These should work through your driver.</li>
					<li>Plugins are all loading without errors.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Ok! Let's get going on a great song....hold on. First we need to know what the heck everything is. The first place to start are the global controls, as these will apply to every subsequent thing we do.</p>
				<p>The DAW layout is fairly strightforward once the user is familiar with it.</p>
				<p>The top is the menu bar. Most functions can be found here and there are many to play around with. The basics will be New files, Opening Files, Saving Files, Exporting, and Midi items.</p>
				<p>Underneath the menu bar are the global controls. These include playback buttons (play, stop, ff, etc.) Tempo, Time Signature, Metronome, Grid controls, and a few others.</p>
				<p>The left hand side will contain a list of the tracks being used in the piece. Each track has input, output, fx, volume, and many other controls.</p>
				<p>The right side of the screen is the timeline. This will be where your actual music is written, played back and edited.</p>
				<p>Alright, now lets's get started. First pick a Tempo for the piece. Ballads will typically be slow, and rousing music will be faster. Pick what you want and move to the Time Signature. This will dictate how many beats are in a bar, and what value a beat is. Turn the metronome on and see if the tempo and time signature are to your liking. Once they are you can move on to tracks.</p>

				<p>Tracks can come in two main flavors, midi and audio clips. Midi is programmable directly into the computer with a mouse, keyboard, or a midi device such as a hard synth if you have one. Without and device inputs, you will have to stick with midi to make tracks.</p>
				<p>With no devices, you will want to add a new midi item to write your music in. Add it to the first track, and give the track a name for its role. Load a virtual instrument up and make sure its making sound. Now open your midi item. Most modern DAWs will default to using a piano roll to write music on. Start dragging pitches out for different periods of time, play them back and edit them. This takes time and is where you will start to form your ideas into playable music.</p>
				<p>If you have a midi device, you can record straight from your instrument, and the computer will write the midi for you. You can edit times and pitches after the fact as well. Make sure to give yourself some play-in space so you are ready to record in time with the music!</p>
				<p>Real audio clips can be recorded through an audio interface. Plug your instrument directly into the interface, test it out, and record. The sound quality will be much better than fake midi insturments, but its harder to edit. Take your time and experiment.</p>
				<p>Want to jazz up your sounds? Put some distortion and delay on and re-play back your music. Effects are fun to play with and can change the feel of the music. They won't save a bad piece but can enhance a good core concept. Again experimentation will lead to interesting outcomes.</p>

				<p>Taking initial ideas to completion is usually a lot of work and requires dedication. Don't give up! Add tracks, edit your clips and keep working. Clips can be copied and pasted to help speed up the composition process. They can also be faded in and out for effect. Try fading out the end of your piece slowly. Maybe take a track that sounds off and play it on another instrument. Automtion can also create professional sounding effects when done correctly. Try programming volume fluxuations, or increasing/decreasing the amount of an effect used over time. These tools can be very efficient at performing a lot of sound manipulation over time. Practice is the key.</p>

				<p>Finally done? Hang on! Before your work is finished, you want to make sure its mastered and exported so that everyone can hear what you hear. Mixing and Mastering is a deep subjet, but the basic premise is to edit the sound so that everything fits together nicely, without anything too loud or too quiet. Usually a master channel will have its own volume and possibly effects for you to mess with. Try to get everything sounding as good as you can.</p>
				<p>Finally you can save your file, and render it. You will want to use your computers resources to decide how big you want the file and how high of quality the sound will be. Watch and make sure none of the piece clips above 0dB or you may get some feedback. You can always go back and re-render if you don't get it right the first time.</p>
				<p>That's it! Your music is created and fit for playing anywhere you can play it. Hopefully this guide helped you get started on a long and fruitful journey into digital music!</p>
