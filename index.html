	User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "Javascript and Java" should have a corresponding id="Javascript_and_Java").
User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).
User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.
User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.
User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.
User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.

			<header>Overview</header>
				<p>So you want to make music. These days with the advent of modern digital technology, a lot can be accomplished with a simple laptop, a few pieces of hardware, and some basic software. Just getting started? No need to drop thousands of dollars on expensive and often complex equipment. This simple guide will give you all the tools you need to begin your foray into the rewarding field of modern musical production.</p>
				<p></p>
		</section>
		<section class="main-section">
			<header>Requirements</header>
				<p>Before beginning, their are some baseline considerations that need to be met in order to have a usable working environment. Trying to force an underpowered workstation beyond its limits will end in hours wasted in frustration with little to nothing to show for it. In order to have a usable setup, the following basic items need to be present:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Mid-tier computer: at a minimum, a computer will need:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Multi-core processor. Dual core is okay, quad core (or more) is better. Anything older will be too slow.</li>
						<li>1GB Ram. Most new computers should have 2 or 4 GB (or more) and more is always better.</li>
						<li>160GB Storage. Technically you can use less, but if you start making lots of projects you will soon run out of space. SSDs will also speed up loading times.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Audio Playback. There's not much point in making music if you can't hear it. Speakers are recommended but headphones can work ok if you are just starting out.<li>
					<li>These two are necessary. If you want to expand your abilities, consider the following:</li>
					<li>Optional: Hard synth. Keyboards are the top compostion tools of the musical world for a reason. The highly visual nature of the keyboard is very useful in crafting music, whatever the type. Start with a solid budget option, and upgrade as you hit its limits.</li>
					<li>Optional: Audio Interface. Not only will this improve audio output controls, it will also also for real instruments and microphones to be recorded. Depending on the style of music this could be intergral to the sound.</li>
				</ul>

			<header>Setup</header>
				<p>Now that you have the tools, let's learn how to set them up for success. The two main componenets to making music on your computer are Software and Hardware. Let's take a quick look at each.</p>
				<p>Software</p>
				<p>On the software side of things, there are several components to install and configure into working order.</p>
				<p>Driver</p>
				<p>The driver will handle all of the inputs and outputs from the main software as requests to and from the computer. The simplest, easiest and cheapest (free) solution is a community built one that many people utilize called ASIO4ALL. Simply download and install and the driver will be taken care of (note: an audio interface may have its own driver to install and use).</p>
				<p>Audio Software</p>
				<p>There are many options for audio software out on the market today. A relatively inexpensive, robust, and free to try option is Reaper by cuckos. Again download and install.</p>
				<p>Plugins</p>
				<p>This section will make more sense once you get started, but essentially the effects and virtual instruments at your disposal come down to the plugins you have installed. A good place to start is to look up and try free plugins first, and purchase professional options once you have more experinece.</p>
				<p>Now lets look at Hardware.</p>
				<p>Hardware</p>
				<p>The first piece of hardware, the computer, has already been taken care of above. </p>
